Hi Chad,

 

Gotta say, I'm a fan of your culture, product (Stacks), and niche. I get the feeling I would grow in your company.

 

I noticed you advertise weekly releases -- you're closer to bi-weekly, judging by your release history. Is that why you're looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer?

 

 

I'm very interested in this role. My experience is broad - but applicable. Your model reminds me of another SAAS product I worked on, and your target market is strangely wholesome. I think I would feel good about the work that I do alongside you.

 

I think you're Good. You're Agile, Customer-centric, with a desire to Continually Improve. I admire that, and I want to be a part of it.

 

I want to be Agile, to empathize with our Customers, and experience the sense of meaning, and fulfillment that comes with having tangibly improved people's lives, in some small way. I'm a firm believer, and it's obvious from reading the Stacks release notes that you are as well.

 

As I see it, DevOps exists to systematically eliminate the pains from the processes around building software.
