Dear Friends, and Esteemed Fellows,

I'll start by saying that I need a new gig, and am both open to new opportunities, and eager to start.
I'd also like to tell you Why.

The original reason why, it was so I could work remotely, although not to work from home. I saw that, and thought that if I could work from home, I could work from anywhere - I could travel, and see the world, and support myself while doing it. That was the Dream, and it was in it's service that I taught myself to code, and spent all my time learning - all in the service of the noble future self.

I realized soon after that there was more to this, than a simple means to an end. This was a vehicle for change - for making a real impact upon the world, and so many people in it. This was a chance to give my life meaning, in the service of the Greater Good -- the Noble Ideal.

Authenticity, it could be called. Necessity is another word, and it's from this that I say yes to that which fails to serve my own ambitions, and live with it, for a time. That period of time is approximately 4 months.

It's at this turning point that I begin to wonder:
	Is the work that I am doing meaningful?
	Is the work I am doing in accordance with my own values?
	Can I see a future here?







The original reason Why was that I could work remotely, but when I heard "work from home", what I saw was 





so that I could travel, and see the world, and make new friends in it without being constrained to a fixed address. It's a life I knew once, 

I'll tell you why I got into Tech - I wanted a job I could work remotely, not so that I could work from home, per-se, but rather wherever home might be. I never know where that's going to be, or whether anything is going to last, and I 

I'll tell you why I got into this industry, and it's because of people like you, and how normal I felt in the presence of people who want to change the world









I've taken this past month to reflect on my experience. That includes my time with eMotors Direct, most recently, however extends to the totality of my professional experience. What I need is a job, but what I want is for you to understand why.

I'll start with the word Trust. Working as a Developer, I very often find myself working with someone else's code, and that's proven alright when what I'm using is a well-documented library, with an automated test suite, and clean code. Excuse me, if I want to laugh, but don't, because I'm genuinely grateful for the work these people have put in, and am left to wonder why none of the code I've been paid to work with has looked like this.

The word here is DevOps, and there are so many others. Lean, Agile, Scrum. Refactoring. Test-Driven Development. Red-Green-Refactor. Don't Repeat Yourself. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.

I'm a self-taught Developer, having first learned Ruby on Rails, and some of the first wisdom imparted upon me were these things. One of the first meetups I went to was a DevOps meetup in Victoria, at which I 







 To question what I've accomplished, if anything, and to find out what I most enjoyed

I've taken a month to reflect, and while I have an ask, it didn't feel

I've taken a month to reflect, on my experience, my needs, my dreams, and the fact I've yet to reach them.



As of now, and as of September 22, 2023, 

I emerge from a month of contemplation, following the end of my time working for  eMotors Direct. 

It's with a tinge of sadness that I must announce the end of my time with eMotors Direct, and correspondingly, 

I write you now from a place of need, humility, and after one month's contemplation. 
I want you to know that I am Human.
I want you to know why I'm Good.

As of September 22, 2023 I am a free agent, though I can afford to be. I need work, but I also needed to understand why I'm here again.
