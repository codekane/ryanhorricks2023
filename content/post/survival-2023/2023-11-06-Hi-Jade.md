Hi Jade,

I'm looking to drum up work, and your name comes to mind. Probably because I ran kegs at the arena in Victoria during the World Juniors of Hockey, a few years back, and while I certainly had fun, I also got to the scale of consumption during one of these events. Your business is both sound, and to me, it sounds like a lot of fun. I get why you do what you do, and I want to be a part of it.

I don't know your needs, but I bring passion to everything I do, be that Development, QA, Product, and even Promotion. I'm not big on sports, and have not used your product, however I have empathy for the people that do, including, perhaps crucially, the very runners that serve as the backbone of your service. I've seen your presentation, and I find your aspirations both admirable, and realistic. I specialize in pain - it's perception, and elimination from the lives of those I serves provides meaning, and I can wear many hats, so as to serve many needs.

I'd love to chat, if there's anything you might need from me, because what I need is meaning, and your product's in the wild, meaning every act counts.
