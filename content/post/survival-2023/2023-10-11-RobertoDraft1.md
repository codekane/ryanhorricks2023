I forgot all about that dream. 

I forget things like that, when I'm not around people that make think











 I've been thinking about Place, and actually Real Estate as a kind-of a low-key testing ground for these technologies. 

I'm thinking Alexa that'll swear at you, and conversely seek to console you, or exploit your emotional state to

This Job Sounds Fun. I keep reading it over, and it's simply wonderful, in so many ways.



In fact, it's reminded me of a Dream I had. I want to make an AI that can understand human emotions, and engage with them. Collect gross amounts of user-identifiable data by selling them a microphone in something cool, and use it to train models to recognize a given User's voice, and tone for listening to commands without being prompted. I'd forgotten about that Dream, but it's a direction I'd eventually like to go.

Perhaps at the same time as I've got consenting adults to strap microcontrollers, and microphones to themselves willingly.

That's just me, though, and it's because my time is, increasingly, scarce. If I can call it a day job, then I can give it 8 hours of my time to focus on nothing else. Eight hours can mean a vastly different thing, depending on the company you keep. Some people remind you of your Dreams, and the things that Excite you, and of the ways in which you can be better. 

Some people lack discipline, humility, and/or the will to speak Truly. 



I'll tell you something True.  Last Summer, when I took a month to get back to you, after meeting your team.

I was doing the same thing I spent the last 3 weeks doing -- writing, rewriting my resume, trying to find a good story. What I want is a Great Story, and a part of it was supposed to entail the Adventurer archtype. It's why I got into Tech, actually, and I've yet to realize this Dream of mine. I was worried last year, because it was mentioned that you get together every Wednesday with the team, and I worried this wasn't enough "freedom" for me.

I've come to learn there is joy in association, congregation, and spending time amongst your fellows. I've come to realize that I don't necessarily want to leave forever, and that it could serve me to buy property here in Edmonton. I recall one of your companies values is Building Wealth, and over time I seem to have grown into alignment with that, as I try to find a way to have it all.

I hear you're located at the WorkNicer. Walked by there the other day before I knew, and I thought it looked fun. Kind of a Hostel vibe. I'm cool with a sense of community, comradery, and collaboration, and leaving my house one day a week to socialize. It'd be really cool if I could have that, and not have it be a prison. 



Mostly, what I need is a beginning that doesn't have to end. I do good work, follow best practices, and act with empathy towards the next person to do what I'm doing. I follow Best Practices, even when nobody else cares to know what they are, because I know why they are. I've read forum posts from the dawn of Agile, seen startups fail, projects mismanaged, and championed the causes that you've now figured out work. I need to stop trying to change people, and just go somewhere people value the work that I do, and have something meaningful to offer me.



I don't like to enter into relationships when I can see the end from the beginning. Think Childhood Trauma - Employers are Attachments, 





If I'm lucky, I'll come away knowing something that'll save me some time later









I forgot about that Dream because I was in the wrong place for it, and it's naturally Place that's the place. It's like you said: screw up, it doesn't matter. It's not Healthcare, Nuclear Physics, Banking, Government. It's Real-Estate. 

Anybody can do Real-Estate. 



 I find that's what tends to happen, when you're around the wrong people. 



It's funny, though, because up until I read this Job Description, I'd forgotten about that Dream. Something about how you become like that which surrounds you.



Personally, my Dream with AI would be to gift it the ability to comprehend human emotion. 







It wasn't until May of this year that I really got to wrap my head around this whole "AI" thing. I got it into my head that I wanted to gift a robot with empathy, care, and considerations, such that its continued existence might be a veritable boon on mankind, in contrast to the dystopian blue borne of ignorant foibles.



I have a Dream for you. It's about this AI, 





I had a Dream back in May. Attending Upper Bound was my first real exposure to AI, and 







I like the sound of what you're doing, and I think that Place is a Great Place to do it.









This is a fun one... Really Fun.

It's exciting, what I see in this Job Description. 

I haven't gotten a chance to get deep into AI, yet. I crash coursed it in the evenings during Upper Bound, and it brought to mind a lot of fun ideas. 



I've been meaning to write you, for the past couple of weeks. I spent them staring at myself on a piece of paper, picking out the flaws, finding interesting tidbits, and bits and pieces of everything that I've done.

Now, I haven't done any of these things
