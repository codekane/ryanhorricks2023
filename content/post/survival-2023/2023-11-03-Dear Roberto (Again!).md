I wanted to reach out --

My major concern, last summer, was your Wednesday meetings being incompatible with The Dream, which was for remote work to serve as a vehicle for travel. Had I come from a place of Trust, and Authenticity then, as I do now, then I am certain all concerns could be resolved.

Today I am humble, because what I need is quite basic, and that's to be paid what I'm worth, to performing meaningful work, and to serve something greater, be they people, or product, or the realization of a shared vision. If you're properly Agile, you can just keep doing you, and I'll probably be happy.

Tomorrow I'm giant, because my dreams are big, and I'm always growing. This year I've built hardware, and next year is AI.. I don't qualify for your NLP Engineer position today, however reading the description reminded me of where I am going. Microcontrollers, microphones, and a voice assistant trained on the individual nuances of my own voice, based on a heap of user-specific data. I want it to read my mind, know how I feel, and perhaps to respond accordingly.

I want to work for Place, because that choice today determines who I will become tomorrow, and so I make this choice with intention. I need a place that I can stay, and grow, and use as a cultural model for my own endeavours. This is what I need, so that I can be who I am, an in exchange you can have me, for the forseeable future.

And I mean every word, Roberto. Maybe that's what it takes, to turn a maybe into a yes.
