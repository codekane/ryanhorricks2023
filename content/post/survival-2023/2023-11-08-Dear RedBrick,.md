Dear RedBrick,

My name is Ryan, and I have trust issues. That's awful, but it's on account of them that I am ideal for this role, because it's by virtue of a robust suite of automated tests that I can give others the means to trust each others work, and to ship faster, higher quality code.

In this role I can promise to take responsibility for the health of your codebase, the happiness of your customers, and the enablement of your developers to confidently ship quality code. I will champion DevOps, and seek to eliminate the pain not just of your customers, but of your staff, and I will document the process, so as to communicate learnings, and ensure that your product does not suffer in the event that I am hit by a bus.

I'm a self-taught developer, 6 years in, and I've worked for several startups. I'm active in my local community (Edmonton), however I've got family in Victoria, and I don't mind taking trips to visit... I'd do it just to escape the cold, however I've got my own ambitions, those being my own startup, and my connections in Edmonton are too valuable to outright leave -- think the investors I'm building relationships with, prior to the outright need to raise capital.

I'm applying for this role because:

A) If I'm automating tests that means my days will be varied. Manual QA, while necessary, is hellishly inefficient as the sole source of QA
B) You're a startup, albeit grown, and I want to understand what makes you tick
C) I'm damned good at finding, and eliminating pain, and do it regardless of title. This position would empower me to effect meaningful change.

I would love to be considered for this position, and given the opportunity to meet with me, I think you will understand the passion that I bring to my work, and perhaps realize the immense value that I bring.

I'll learn anything I need. What I need from you is the means to perform meaningful work. Do I get to make a difference, and help eradicate the pains of your organization? Because to me, that prospect is inherently, and incredibly motivating.

With Truth and Love,
Ryan Horricks
