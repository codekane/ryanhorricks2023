# Oct. 11, 2023 - Dear Roberto,.md
Dear Roberto,

I've read this Job Description over, several times now, and it still sounds Fun.

Funny, also, because I'm reminded of a Dream I'd forgotten about. It was Upper Bound, and I told a couple of students that I wanted to train an AI to understand tone, emotion, and whether or not they're spoken to without requiring a prompt. Collect gross amounts of user-identifiable data (hook up a microphone to a microcontroller, and convince people to wear it), and use it to train models.

Little bit Sci-Fi. Hardware is presently limiting, although likely quit capable of aforementioned data collection.



I forgot all about that. Ostensibly I've had an interest, but professionally I've found myself rather unappreciated. It's said that I'm doing the "hard thing", which is only hard without Giants on your team leaving good patterns to follow. Things like Code Reviews are still mythical to me, and the only Agile I've worked alongside has been Fake Agile. Practices have been defined by Junior Developers, who shouldn't be Juniors, except for a lack of investment in their growth. Founders who have been blinded by the view up top, smelling of funky numbers, ignorant to the consequence of shoddy work, and eager to divest responsibilities to third world labourers.



I've kept going, six years now. The reason why, from the beginning, is that I wanted the ability to work remotely from places that are not Edmonton.

It used to be harder, and faster, but now I think I'd be content with "sometimes". I'm happy to get out of the house, network, socialize, learn, grow, collaborate, and build relationships. These are all positives, and are undoubtedly serving your team well.

I was afraid of these Nice Things. Traumatized, really. People, and Power, and Trust.





I'm working on it. 

Seriously, though... It's been 6 years, and I still haven't done it. Haven't gone anywhere. It means a lot to me.



Other side, is that I want to enjoy my work, such that I can look 3 months down the line and anticipate being generally satisfied.

Meaning, I'm Growing, I'm Learning, and I'm helping others to do the same.



# Oct. 24, 2023 - Dear Friends, and Esteemed Fellows,.md

Dear Friends, and Esteemed Fellows,

I'll start by saying that I need a new gig, and am both open to new opportunities, and eager to start.
I'd also like to tell you Why.

The original reason why, it was so I could work remotely, although not to work from home. I saw that, and thought that if I could work from home, I could work from anywhere - I could travel, and see the world, and support myself while doing it. That was the Dream, and it was in it's service that I taught myself to code, and spent all my time learning - all in the service of the noble future self.

I realized soon after that there was more to this, than a simple means to an end. This was a vehicle for change - for making a real impact upon the world, and so many people in it. This was a chance to give my life meaning, in the service of the Greater Good -- the Noble Ideal.

Authenticity, it could be called. Necessity is another word, and it's from this that I say yes to that which fails to serve my own ambitions, and live with it, for a time. That period of time is approximately 4 months.

It's at this turning point that I begin to wonder:
	Is the work that I am doing meaningful?
	Is the work I am doing in accordance with my own values?
	Can I see a future here?







The original reason Why was that I could work remotely, but when I heard "work from home", what I saw was 





so that I could travel, and see the world, and make new friends in it without being constrained to a fixed address. It's a life I knew once, 

I'll tell you why I got into Tech - I wanted a job I could work remotely, not so that I could work from home, per-se, but rather wherever home might be. I never know where that's going to be, or whether anything is going to last, and I 

I'll tell you why I got into this industry, and it's because of people like you, and how normal I felt in the presence of people who want to change the world









I've taken this past month to reflect on my experience. That includes my time with eMotors Direct, most recently, however extends to the totality of my professional experience. What I need is a job, but what I want is for you to understand why.

I'll start with the word Trust. Working as a Developer, I very often find myself working with someone else's code, and that's proven alright when what I'm using is a well-documented library, with an automated test suite, and clean code. Excuse me, if I want to laugh, but don't, because I'm genuinely grateful for the work these people have put in, and am left to wonder why none of the code I've been paid to work with has looked like this.

The word here is DevOps, and there are so many others. Lean, Agile, Scrum. Refactoring. Test-Driven Development. Red-Green-Refactor. Don't Repeat Yourself. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.

I'm a self-taught Developer, having first learned Ruby on Rails, and some of the first wisdom imparted upon me were these things. One of the first meetups I went to was a DevOps meetup in Victoria, at which I 







 To question what I've accomplished, if anything, and to find out what I most enjoyed

I've taken a month to reflect, and while I have an ask, it didn't feel

I've taken a month to reflect, on my experience, my needs, my dreams, and the fact I've yet to reach them.



As of now, and as of September 22, 2023, 

I emerge from a month of contemplation, following the end of my time working for  eMotors Direct. 

It's with a tinge of sadness that I must announce the end of my time with eMotors Direct, and correspondingly, 

I write you now from a place of need, humility, and after one month's contemplation. 
I want you to know that I am Human.
I want you to know why I'm Good.

As of September 22, 2023 I am a free agent, though I can afford to be. I need work, but I also needed to understand why I'm here again.



# Oct. 31, 2023 - dear-Chad.txt,
Hi Chad,  

Gotta say, I'm a fan of your culture, product (Stacks), and niche. I get the feeling I would grow in your company.

I noticed you advertise weekly releases -- you're closer to bi-weekly, judging by your release history. Is that why you're looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer?

I'm very interested in this role. My experience is broad - but applicable. Your model reminds me of another SAAS product I worked on, and your target market is strangely wholesome. I think I would feel good about the work that I do alongside you.

I think you're Good. You're Agile, Customer-centric, with a desire to Continually Improve. I admire that, and I want to be a part of it.

I want to be Agile, to empathize with our Customers, and experience the sense of meaning, and fulfillment that comes with having tangibly improved people's lives, in some small way. I'm a firm believer, and it's obvious from reading the Stacks release notes that you are as well.

As I see it, DevOps exists to systematically eliminate the pains from the processes around building software.

# Nov. 03, 2023 - Dear Roberto (Again!).md


I wanted to reach out --

My major concern, last summer, was your Wednesday meetings being incompatible with The Dream, which was for remote work to serve as a vehicle for travel. Had I come from a place of Trust, and Authenticity then, as I do now, then I am certain all concerns could be resolved.

Today I am humble, because what I need is quite basic, and that's to be paid what I'm worth, to performing meaningful work, and to serve something greater, be they people, or product, or the realization of a shared vision. If you're properly Agile, you can just keep doing you, and I'll probably be happy.

Tomorrow I'm giant, because my dreams are big, and I'm always growing. This year I've built hardware, and next year is AI.. I don't qualify for your NLP Engineer position today, however reading the description reminded me of where I am going. Microcontrollers, microphones, and a voice assistant trained on the individual nuances of my own voice, based on a heap of user-specific data. I want it to read my mind, know how I feel, and perhaps to respond accordingly.

I want to work for Place, because that choice today determines who I will become tomorrow, and so I make this choice with intention. I need a place that I can stay, and grow, and use as a cultural model for my own endeavours. This is what I need, so that I can be who I am, an in exchange you can have me, for the forseeable future.

And I mean every word, Roberto. Maybe that's what it takes, to turn a maybe into a yes.

# Nov. 6, 2023 - Hi Jade,.md


Hi Jade,

I'm looking to drum up work, and your name comes to mind. Probably because I ran kegs at the arena in Victoria during the World Juniors of Hockey, a few years back, and while I certainly had fun, I also got to the scale of consumption during one of these events. Your business is both sound, and to me, it sounds like a lot of fun. I get why you do what you do, and I want to be a part of it.

I don't know your needs, but I bring passion to everything I do, be that Development, QA, Product, and even Promotion. I'm not big on sports, and have not used your product, however I have empathy for the people that do, including, perhaps crucially, the very runners that serve as the backbone of your service. I've seen your presentation, and I find your aspirations both admirable, and realistic. I specialize in pain - it's perception, and elimination from the lives of those I serves provides meaning, and I can wear many hats, so as to serve many needs.

I'd love to chat, if there's anything you might need from me, because what I need is meaning, and your product's in the wild, meaning every act counts.


# Nov. 8, 2023 - Dear RedBrick,.md

Dear RedBrick,

My name is Ryan, and I have trust issues. That's awful, but it's on account of them that I am ideal for this role, because it's by virtue of a robust suite of automated tests that I can give others the means to trust each others work, and to ship faster, higher quality code.

In this role I can promise to take responsibility for the health of your codebase, the happiness of your customers, and the enablement of your developers to confidently ship quality code. I will champion DevOps, and seek to eliminate the pain not just of your customers, but of your staff, and I will document the process, so as to communicate learnings, and ensure that your product does not suffer in the event that I am hit by a bus.

I'm a self-taught developer, 6 years in, and I've worked for several startups. I'm active in my local community (Edmonton), however I've got family in Victoria, and I don't mind taking trips to visit... I'd do it just to escape the cold, however I've got my own ambitions, those being my own startup, and my connections in Edmonton are too valuable to outright leave -- think the investors I'm building relationships with, prior to the outright need to raise capital.

I'm applying for this role because:

A) If I'm automating tests that means my days will be varied. Manual QA, while necessary, is hellishly inefficient as the sole source of QA
B) You're a startup, albeit grown, and I want to understand what makes you tick
C) I'm damned good at finding, and eliminating pain, and do it regardless of title. This position would empower me to effect meaningful change.

I would love to be considered for this position, and given the opportunity to meet with me, I think you will understand the passion that I bring to my work, and perhaps realize the immense value that I bring.

I'll learn anything I need. What I need from you is the means to perform meaningful work. Do I get to make a difference, and help eradicate the pains of your organization? Because to me, that prospect is inherently, and incredibly motivating.

With Truth and Love,
Ryan Horricks


# Nov. 13, 2023 - Dear, Dear, Dear Granify.md

Dear Granify,

This was the first job in the tech industry that I ever applied to, around this time in November, 2020. I recall a sprawling interview process over weeks, where I met with your Vice President, QA Lead, and finally, Jeff, who I told of my desire to switch to Development when I felt ready (~9 months). I didn't get the job.

I applied for that Development position around this time last year, however I took my sweet time completing the assessment -- I'd already done it, and it failed to teach me anything new. I like to learn, and I like to grow, and it felt like a waste of my time, and so I in turn wasted a bit of yours.

That's awfully petty, but I'm Human, and I'm working on it. Fact is that I've grown substantially over the years. I recall interviewing with a British chap for the Development role. He had a bit of a condescending tone in response to my allusion to the AI portion of your company being magic, to which I had no ambitions. That's not really a Granify thing, I think he's just British. They're just like that.

That was the past. Presently, I've made peace with who I am, and what I have to offer -- I speciaize in pain. That's an awfully unpleasant specialty, in the wrong environment. In the time since I first approached Granify, I've worked at startups where I was expected to manually test the same painful features, and suffer under the burden of an antagonistic developer team, and been forced to concede that, they were correct to be rude, because that's how they could live with themselves while working for a couple of non-technical founders, and specifically the COO, who was so smart that she seemed to look down on any form of intelligence that was not her purview... Not to say she wasn't smart, moreso that she is crazy.

My NDA expired this month, so I get to tell stories. Fact is, I've been around. I know what works, I know what doesn't, and I've learned that I actually garner a profound sense of meaning and importance in providing others with the means to trust. I like writing automated tests, and saying that, my last job was amongst those who, not only wrote no tests, but in fact wrote untestable code. I left them with every functionality I had to scour documented, some nice patterns, and the freedom to continue their present approach -- they ultimately were ensuring their own job's security, and I cannot say that's wrong.

Me? I don't care about security. I'm all about startups, and I've spent every penny I've made this year, and every hour I had to spare on my own. I've only paid half my rent this month, which is okay, because it means I get to talk to you, and tell you a story. 



When I first applied to you, I was naive. I went to my first Launch Party this year, and saw Granify amongst those up on stage many years ago. Next year, that could be me.



I'm applying for this role because I'm extremely effective at finding what's wrong, and I'm lazy, so if I can do it once, do it well, write a script, and automate the entire job? Heck Yeah. Not only that, but given a few months, I'll be able to tell you not just what's wrong, but also why -- this means process, people, culture. My only hope is that someone cares about improving those things, because I care deeply, and It's profoundly demotivating, and in fact degrading, to work in the company of those who do not care to right what's wrong. I'm capable of better, and something tells me you're already there.

Now, I'm going to close by saying this isn't addressed to Jeff, because this is the sort of cover letter you're welcome to print off, and post to your fridge. It's funny, but the letters I've sent you, Granify, are some of my best -- this must be why I keep getting interviews. I'd like another one. I'm serious about the QA path here, and while I might not last forever (Launch Party), I can promise you that I structure my work such that, were I to be hit by a bus tomorrow, you would be fine. The code is clean, documented, and everything you need in my absence will be had. Because I care about the Product, and the People. I'm the sort who'll get fired, and then message the guy who fired me on LinkedIn to tip him off about a promising local startup I saw pitch, and its relation to what he's doing.

So, without further adieu, and with a bit of love, I'm signing off of this letter. Jeff - if you're reading this. I hope your daughter is well, and I would love to find out what's become of you since we first spoke. It was a different time, a different dream, and I was a more damaged person. Asked for hobbies I said drinking, but that was not always me, nor is it now. I prefer screaming as I fall off the wall, attemping to master a challenging set at Boulders Climbing, these days. How rare in life, to fall freely.

Surprising even myself,
Ryan Horricks
