Dear Roberto,

I've read this Job Description over, several times now, and it still sounds Fun.

Funny, also, because I'm reminded of a Dream I'd forgotten about. It was Upper Bound, and I told a couple of students that I wanted to train an AI to understand tone, emotion, and whether or not they're spoken to without requiring a prompt. Collect gross amounts of user-identifiable data (hook up a microphone to a microcontroller, and convince people to wear it), and use it to train models.

Little bit Sci-Fi. Hardware is presently limiting, although likely quit capable of aforementioned data collection.



I forgot all about that. Ostensibly I've had an interest, but professionally I've found myself rather unappreciated. It's said that I'm doing the "hard thing", which is only hard without Giants on your team leaving good patterns to follow. Things like Code Reviews are still mythical to me, and the only Agile I've worked alongside has been Fake Agile. Practices have been defined by Junior Developers, who shouldn't be Juniors, except for a lack of investment in their growth. Founders who have been blinded by the view up top, smelling of funky numbers, ignorant to the consequence of shoddy work, and eager to divest responsibilities to third world labourers.



I've kept going, six years now. The reason why, from the beginning, is that I wanted the ability to work remotely from places that are not Edmonton.

It used to be harder, and faster, but now I think I'd be content with "sometimes". I'm happy to get out of the house, network, socialize, learn, grow, collaborate, and build relationships. These are all positives, and are undoubtedly serving your team well.

I was afraid of these Nice Things. Traumatized, really. People, and Power, and Trust.





I'm working on it. 

Seriously, though... It's been 6 years, and I still haven't done it. Haven't gone anywhere. It means a lot to me.



Other side, is that I want to enjoy my work, such that I can look 3 months down the line and anticipate being generally satisfied.

Meaning, I'm Growing, I'm Learning, and I'm helping others to do the same.
