Hello again, Brandon.

I'd like to start with who I am, and why I want to work at a startup.

The short answer is that I would not be who I am without it, but why?

Let's start at the beginning. The year was 2017, and I'd left behind the remains of my life here in Edmonton. I knew a girl in Malaysia, and she'd invited me to come, and so I went, on a one-way ticket, and I left my life behind.
The obvious thought is that I went there for the girl, and I did, but it didn't last. In our last weeks together she took me to a Music Festival, Good Vibes, and while we were on the outs I made a friend, Azam. I moved into a spare
room of his, shortly thereafter, and found he was of a different sort than the people in the world I'd left behind. Son of a politican, highly educated, and impressively musical, and entrepreneurial -- he was on a down slope when
I met him, but he'd successfully founded a company that made things out of trash, and sold them. My first taste of what was to come.

Through Azam I met Fizul. Fizul had a daughter, and I admired that about him, asking his age, and putting into relation to mine, helping me to feel like I still had time. He showed me his life, introduced me to his family, they 
having had a Canadian family as friends growing up, it seemed natural. Through his mother I was introduced to Jasmine Low, who herself had a startup, running a marketing agency/web development shop to finance her pursuits. It's
through Jasmine, and the people I met, and the experiences I had in her employ that I came to understand just what was possible in this world. I'd never been in a room before with so many intelliigent, ambitions, intelligent people.
I'd never imagined that was who I could become, until I was there, with them, and I Found that I fit.

And then I came back to a broken world, with nothing, no-one, and not even my self, any more. I'd found who I wanted to be, but I had not yet made myself. I moved to Calgary, rented a room for $400, and on the advice of a friend, 
set out to teach myself to code - to become a Full Stack Developer.

At first it was hard, and I felt like bashing my head a lot, but it started to click, and it was the most important thing. I did not lead a good life, by many metrics, and yet I was driven in the pursuit of my goal. To become the 
very best version of myself. I taught myself Ruby, and I learned to write scripts. I taught myself how to use the terminal to code, because my antiquated equipment could not handle the fancy IDE's I was suggested. My very first 
year I decided to start something of my own - a video conferencing site for my friends to use. It was my first ever real Full-Stack project, and I was treating it like a business. I put it above else in my life, devoting hours to 
code that I didn't have to spend, finding the prospect of performing work of lesser value to be unpalatable, in comparison to doing something that could get me what I really wanted.

The year was 2018, and I went to Victoria that winter. Ostensibly, I was fleeing the cold, but actually I'd just thrown out most of my belongings after acquiring bedbugs, and had nothing really to lose, so I went to Victoria, and 
I was homeless, and yet still, what I wanted more than anything was to join the tech industry. I carried 60lbs of baggage, including a blanket, and my laptop, and I walked with that burden, going to the library to work on my 
project. After a week I went to a DevOps meetup in Victoria, and it's an experience I haven't been able to replicate until discovering Amii, which is where I met you. Anyways, at that meetup I hid the fact that I was homeless, 
while I could, enjoying the free pizza and beers, however the secret had to come out eventually, and I was invited out for drinks afterwards - they offered to pay. I met someone there who tried to get me a job. First he tried to 
let me sleep on his couch, but I declined -- I'd just acquired a new pop-up tent, and really wanted to try it out. I went down to the docks, popped my tent, curled up in my down blanket, and I missed my first shot.

There was another shot, but being homeless takes its toll. You become that which surrounds you, and that was something I felt the need to escape, leaving towards Vancouver in the new year with $1000 I'd made brokering a deal, once 
again being able to hide the fact that I was homeless long enough to land a job at the hostel, and then falling in love with a girl there who had just come from Edmonton. I got drunk on the liquor some roommates from Boston had 
left me, bought a plane ticket, quit my job, and found that I was going back alone. No matter. It's the next part of the story.

So I got back to Edmonton, crashed on a friends couch, shacked up with a street preacher, and then fled to a mansion filled with hippies who harboured me for this next phase. I got to know them, introduced myself as I am, and 
when told of their plight I thought to solve it through code. To create another business. I found an open source library for multi-vendor marketplaces built on Ruby on Rails that I intended to use, got it running, and discovered 
that what I had in mind was much Bigger than what these people needed. So i made them a static site, doing everything by hand, putting in far too much work, no closer to my goal and yet stymied by my need, and by the lack of 
boundaries between my work and my life. Funny, as I say that, I'm here again.

Well, that was 2019. The website I launched didn't help them, but as I was leaving I created a Product I'm still quite fond of this day, my pocketbook. I packed my bags, went back to be homeless in Victoria, only this time I 
didn't have the goood sense not to trust people, and my first night the bulk of my possessions were stolen. I awoke to the laptop bag I was using as a pillow being pulled up from under me by a man on a bicycle. I set out to chase, 
only I was groggy, and naked, having taken off all my clothes inside my sleeping bag the night before as an exercise in trust. I tripped, and I fell, and I got back up, and I chased but, after noting he was leading by a couple of 
blocks, I was forced to realize. The battle was lost, and I was running naked in downtown Victoria on a weekday. I had one set of clothes stashed in the bottom of my sleeping bag, and I put them on, surveying what was left. I had 
my guitar, still, that I didn't know how to play, saffe because I'd clamped the neck of my travel bag oover the top of it, and my assailants not seeking to make any noise.

I made it back to Edmonton, after calling my mom, who lives in Kamloops, and relating the story. She drove down to Vancouver to pick me up, took me back with her, and then, solely to get rid of me, she drove me back down to Edmonton, 
where I slept on my stepfathers couch, much to my sister's duress for a week, until I was able to work up the nerve to ask the one person I knew who could help, to help. I'd picked up an eeePC from 2010 while I was in Victoria. It 
had 1GB of RAM, and was painfully slow, but I installed linux on it, and got back to work coding. I'd lost my notebooks along the way, and worked on them, as though they were the most important thing in this world.

I built an app to create notebook pages, and I was going to make a business out of it. Meanwhile, I also had my hat. I forgot to tell you about the hat.


Where to begin? With who I am, of course, however I wonder if that's a person you even know, yet. Well, let's change that.

I'd like to start by re-introducing myself. My name is Ryan Horricks, but you already knew that. I've no qualms getting my name out there, but my story, that's much harder to tell. That takes vulnerability, and that's not something
that necessarily comes easily, although it is entirely necessary.

Let's start with the question - the one question you will ask when I apply for this job.

Why do I want to work at a startup?

Anything else would not only bore me, but stymy me. I set out learning to code in 2018, and that's the same year that I realized how much MORE I wanted out of this. I don't want a job. I want to change the world - to take the 
things that annoy me, and improve them. To build things that are useful, and if they're good, to market them, to take them to the world. I treat every project I work on like a business, and that all starts with a prototype. I've
built many prototypes, touching on finance, pharmacokinetics, kanban, video-conferencing, e-commerce. 5 years worth of prototypes, and never was I certain that I had an idea worth following. I was looking for it, and I've kept
looking for it, and I see that you've found it. An idea worth perpetuating. A slice of the world to shape better. That's something I admire.

That's why I got into this, you know. The year was 2017, and I'd boarded a one-way flight to Malaysia some months earlier. No way home, nothing to go back to, and a lot of luck. 






You might think it's funny. Here I am, still trying, and yet that's always been my M.O. -- still trying, still improving, and still so much further to go. Still, I feel as though you don't truly know me yet, and this is the
face of the situation I wish to change.





I am a bombardier in the second mounted division of the Fourth Horse Artillery.

You may well imagine how astonished I was by this revolution in my affairs, and what a violent upheaval it has made in my everyday humdrum existence. Nevertheless I have borne the change with determination and courage, and even derive a certain pleasure from this turn of fortune. Now that I have an opportunity of doing a little athletic training I am more than ever thankful to our Schopenhauer. For the first five weeks I had to be in the stables. At 5:30 in the morning I had to be among the horses, removing the manure and grooming the animals down with the currycomb and horse brush. For the present my work lasts on an average from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 11.30 a.m. to 6 p.m., the greater part of which I spend in parade drill. Four times a week we two soldiers who are to serve for a year have to attend a lecture given by a lieutenant, to prepare us for the reserve officers examination. You must know that in the horse artillery there is a tremendous amount to learn. We get most fun out of the riding lessons. My horse is a very fine animal, and I am supposed to have some talent for riding. When I and my steed gallop round the large parade ground, I feel very contented with my lot. On the whole, too, I am very well treated. Above all, we have a very nice captain.

I have now told you all about my life as a soldier. This is the reason why I have kept you waiting so long for news and for an answer to your last letter. Meanwhile, if I am not mistaken, you will probably have been freed from your military fetters; that is why I thought it would be best to address this letter to Spandau.

But my time is already up; a business letter to Volkmann and another to Ritschl have robbed me of much of it. So I must stop in order to get ready for the parade in full kit.

Well, old man, forgive my long neglect, and hold the god of War responsible for most of it.

Your devoted friend,
